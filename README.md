### Summary
The goal with the Glossolalia Records 2019 was to create a seamless design that's similar to a web-app. This site in particular does not need any user-input for it to function, but it was important to make a responsive layout that almost acts as an app. This was achieved by keeping all of the HTML "sections" that are needed in one index.html document, and upon clicking the navigation items, it displays, or hides, the elements on the page that are not relevant.
